# !!! deeply unserious project !!!
### [!] windows specific

compile with
``` gcc fileinfo.c -o fileinfo.exe ```

run with
``` .\fileinfo <filepath> ```

run recursively (for directories and stuff) with
``` .\fileinfo -r <filepath> ```

idk why i created this

can probably turn this into something serious in the future, but not today
